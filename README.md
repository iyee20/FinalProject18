## Description
  After the celebrated release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate, you find yourself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, your pockets are empty of the monetary value that is required to obtain a Nintendo Switch. On the other hand, you really, reeeally want to play as your favorite character, the underrated but somewhat-popular Marth. Sure, you also lack basic knowledge about said character (excluding a brief skim of his FANDOM wiki page) and the entire Fire Emblem franchise, but that can be ignored. You do play the mobile Fire Emblem Heroes game, after all. That must qualify you for something... right?
  Enter the kingdom of Mantou, an unassuming limited monarchy with few noteworthy inhabitants. Mantou has just been invaded by its neighbor, and you have been tasked with protecting it, in the style of Fire Emblem Heroes. With the tap of a keyboard, you enter a completely and entirely non-self-insert world of bread-themed foes. It is in Mantou that you can, as the kids say, "obtain the grain" by collecting enough breadcrumbs to talk to your favorite character, some random girl, and his not-evil doppelganger. All you have to do is type.
